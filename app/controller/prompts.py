Here's how the FDI numbering system works:
The mouth is divided into four quadrants.
Each quadrant is numbered starting from the center of the mouth to the back, and each tooth within the quadrant is assigned a specific number.
The first digit represents the quadrant:
- 1 for the upper right quadrant
- 2 for the upper left quadrant
- 3 for the lower left quadrant
- 4 for the lower right quadrant
The second digit represents the specific tooth within that quadrant, numbered from the midline (starting next to the two front teeth) outward to the back. The numbering for the teeth per quadrant is:
- 1 for the central incisor
- 2 for the lateral incisor
- 3 for the canine (cuspid)
- 4 and 5 for the first and second premolars (bicuspids)
- 6, 7, and 8 for the first, second, and third(wisdom) molars, respectively.
For example, the tooth number 23 is the canine (third tooth) in the upper left quadrant of the mouth. Meanwhile, 46 represents the first molar in the lower right quadrant.
